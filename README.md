This is a simple fretboard training application, meant to help you
exercise sight-reading on the guitar.  It shows you a randomly
selected note, drawn on a staff in musical notation, which you need to
pick on drawn fretboard.  No attempt has been made to turn it into a
game in any way, such as by counting correct or wrong answer or timing
your responses, as that would have been of doubtful utility.

The program is made up of a simple HTML file, so you can either run it
locally or use it straight from [the GitHub page](https://dpapavas.github.io/fretboard-trainer).
